# Honours Project: Leucadendron argenteum Spectral Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains my Honours project exploring the spectral properties and remote sensing of *Leucadendron argenteum*, a rare and iconic plant species of South Africa. The project involves data analysis, spectral profiling, and geospatial mapping using satellite and airborne remote sensing datasets from the BioSCape campaign (2023).

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this project were downloaded from the following sources:

- [Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) Bioscape 2023 Campaign](https://popo.jpl.nasa.gov/avng/y23_bioscape/)
- [Bioscape NetCDF Data Archive](https://popo.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/bioscape_netCDF/)

Please refer to these links for data access and more information on the campaigns.

## Species Focus

All analyses in this repository focus on **Leucadendron argenteum**.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** I will upload Jupyter notebooks that document my workflow, code, and analysis. These notebooks will show my working steps and results.
- **Data:** Data files are referenced from the above sources and should be downloaded separately due to their size.
- **Scripts:** Any Python scripts or modules used to support the analysis will also be included.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the relevant data from the sources above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to follow the analysis.

## Citation & Acknowledgements

If you use the data or code, please cite the relevant data providers and acknowledge the AVIRIS-NG Bioscape campaign and NASA JPL. Thank you.
